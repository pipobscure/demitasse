# DemiTasse - Simple BDD Test Framework

Simple and small test-framework for node stuff that's basically half of [Mocha](http://mochajs.org). The half it doesn't support is configurability and coverage, since those are easy to add with separate tools.

**Large dependencies are a problem. Use them sparingly but whenever useful. When creating them, keep them light.**

## Install

```bash
npm install --save-dev @pipobscure/demitasse
```

## Usage

_basic-test.js_

```javascript
import { define, it, before, beforeEach, afterEach, after } from '@pipobscure/demitasse';
describe('suite 1', () => {
  it('assertion 1', () => {
    // assert something
  });
  it('assertion 2', () => {
    // assert something
  });
});
```

```bash
npx -p @pipobscure/demitasse basic-test.js
```

`demitasse` has an option to put the functions into the global objects, which enables it to run mocha tests which don't import the library.

> demitasse [--global] [glob-pattern]
> --global : put functions into global object

The `--global` option puts `describe`, `it`, `before`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach`, `after` into the global object, so that test-drivers don't need to require them.

## Motivation

I really like BDD style testing and TAP output. However mocha and its ilk, always bring in everything and the kitchen sink. I don't want to download gigabytes of packages just to have some basic tests; instead I'd rather my test-framework is small and does just what it's core job is.

If I want more (coverage) there are tools for that. Just run the tests with `c8` (or instanbul) and be merry. There is no reason that a test framework needs to be heavy weight.

There is also a [more detailed rationale](./RATIONALE.md) for why it's a good idea to create "yet another test-framework".

## API

All API functions are bound so they can be assigned to scope variables to imitate the global behaviour that Mocha provides.

### describe(name : string, setup : function)

Defines a test. The setup function may contain calls to any of the other API functions. It is however a synchronous function, so you need to use the `before()`, `beforeEach()`, `afterEach()` and `after()` function to do any asynchronous setup.

### describe.skip(name : string, setup : function)

Defines a test just like `describe` except when the tests are actually run these will be skipped.

### describe.only(name : string, setup : function)

Defines a test just like `describe` except when the tests are actually run only those defined via `.only` will actually be executed. However this filtering is per test-suite. So children of tests that are run or other parents are not affected.

### describe.todo(name : string, setup : function)

Defines a test just like `describe` except when the tests are actually run these will be skipped.

### it(name : string, test : function)

Defines an assertion. This function can return a promise which will be awaited before the next assertion is made.

Calling `it()` is illegal outside the synchronous `describe()` setup function.

### it.skip(name : string, test : function)

Defines an assertion just like `it` except that it will be skipped when running the tests.

### it.only(name : string, test : function)

Defines an assertion just like `it` except that when the assertions are actually made only those defined with only (of this suite) will be run.

### it.todo(name : string, test : function)

Defines an assertion just like `it` and marks it as **to do** indicating that a failure is not a regression, but rather unimplemented.

### timeout(name : string, ms: number, test : function)

Defines an assertion that will time out after `ms` milliseconds. This is similar to `it()`, except the test times out after `ms` milli-seconds.

Calling `timeout()` is illegal outside the synchronous `describe()` setup function.

### Setup/Teardown Functions

DemiTasse provides the following Setup/Teardown functions.

- `before(setup : function)`
- `beforeEach(setup : function)`
- `afterEach(setup : function)`
- `after(setup : function)`

The passed runner function may return a then-able to perform asynchronous setup/teardown.
If the returned then-able rejects, the entire test-case fails.

Calling these setup/teardown functions is illegal outside the synchronous `describe()` setup function.
